## 🔄 How It Works

### Particle System
The hero section now has a live 3D particle system with 1500 particles that:
- Rotate continuously in 3D space
- React to mouse movement
- Use gradient colors (cyan → purple → white)
- Create depth with perspective

### Card 3D Effect
When you hover over cards, they:
1. Calculate mouse position relative to card
2. Apply rotation based on position
3. Add radial gradient at mouse location
4. Scale up with depth transformation
5. Cast enhanced shadows

### Parallax Scrolling
As you scroll, different layers move at different speeds:
- **Slow layers**: Create background depth
- **Medium layers**: Main content
- **Fast layers**: Foreground elements

This creates a parallax effect that makes the page feel three-dimensional!
